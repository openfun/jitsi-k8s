# With this Horizontal Pod Autoscaler, we want to ensure that there is
# always at least:
#  - a specific count of jibri pods available (TARGET_MIN_VALUE)
#  - a specific percentage of jibri pods available across all jibri pods (TARGET_PERCENT)
#
# The formula applied by HPA to compute the desired replicas is :
# desiredReplicas = ceil[currentReplicas * ( currentMetricValue / desiredMetricValue )]
# (see https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/horizontal-pod-autoscale/#algorithm-details)
#
# If multiple metrics are specified in HPA, the formula is applied for each of
# them and the higher desiredReplicas is taken into account.
#
# To guarantee that we always have at least TARGET_MIN_VALUE pods available, we
# just have to set this value as minReplicas because the Deployment manages
# only available jibris. When a jibri pod is busy, it gets orphaned and is
# ignored by the Deployment.
#
# To ensure that we have a certain percentage of available pods
# (TARGET_PERCENT), a rule is defined in this HPA based on the "jibri_busy"
# metric, which takes into account all jibri pods in the namespace (those
# managed by the deployment + the orphaned pods that are busy)
